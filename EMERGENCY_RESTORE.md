# ðŸš¨ Emergency Server Restore Guide

The cleanup was too aggressive and removed all channels. Here's how to quickly restore your server:

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Run Setup Command (Recommended)
If the bot is still online and responding:

1. **Type `/setup` command** - This should rebuild all channels from the blueprint
2. **Wait for completion** - The bot will recreate all necessary channels and categories
3. **Check for success** - You should see the full community structure return

### Option 2: Manual Channel Creation (If bot isn't responding)
If the bot isn't working properly:

1. **Create a basic text channel manually:**
   - Right-click in the server
   - "Create Channel" 
   - Name it "general" or "start-here"
   - Make it public

2. **Try `/setup` command again** in the new channel

### Option 3: Server Template Restore (If needed)
If the bot completely broke:

1. **Create new channels manually:**
   - #general
   - #announcements  
   - #start-here

2. **Test bot with `/setup`** once you have a working channel

## ðŸ”§ What Went Wrong

The cleanup function was too broad and matched too many patterns, removing:
- All channels that seemed bot-related
- Even channels that should have been preserved
- All categories regardless of actual ownership

## âœ… Immediate Action Required

**TRY THIS FIRST:**
1. Look for the bot online in your member list
2. Type `/setup` in any remaining channel OR
3. If no channels exist, create one manually first, then run `/setup`

The setup command should restore everything properly with the new gamification system!

## ðŸš€ Expected Result After `/setup`

You should see:
- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome category with start-here, introductions, announcements
- ðŸŽ¯ Find Experts category with job posting channels
- ðŸš€ Hire Me Zone for freelancers
- ðŸ’¬ Automation Chat for technical discussions
- And 5 more organized categories with all channels

## ðŸ“ž If Still Broken

If `/setup` doesn't work:
1. Check bot permissions (needs Administrator or Manage Channels)
2. Check bot is online in member list
3. Try inviting bot again with proper permissions
4. Manually create a "general" channel first, then retry `/setup`
